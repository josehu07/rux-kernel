Rux - An x86_64 toy operating system kernel written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rux is a port of the [Hux kernel](https://github.com/josehu07/hux-kernel), my x86 32-bit single-CPU toy kernel written in C, following [the OSTEP book](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) structure and terminology.

## Development Doc

I document the porting process from Hux to Rux, especially the unique challenges and design choices exposed by porting a legacy C kernel to a modern memory-safe programming language, in the [**WIKI pages üìù**](https://github.com/josehu07/rux-kernel/wiki) of this GitHub repository ‚ú≠.

It is recommended to also take a look at the [wiki pages](https://github.com/josehu07/hux-kernel/wiki) of Hux to know about its basic design and structure.

If there are any typos / mistakes / errors, please raise an issue!


## Playing with Rux

Requires a Linux host development environment. Tested on Ubuntu Focal.

Clone the repo, set up the Rust development toolchain following [this wiki page](https://github.com/josehu07/rux-kernel/wiki/02.-Rust-Development-Setup), then build Rux by:

```bash
$ make
```

<!-- Or, if you just want to try out Rux without a development toolchain, download both the [released](https://github.com/josehu07/rux-kernel/releases) kernel image `rux.iso` and the initial file system image `vsfs.img` (256MB) to the folder. -->

To run Rux in QEMU **>= v6.2.0**, install QEMU & GRUB following [this wiki section](https://github.com/josehu07/rux-kernel/wiki/02.-Rust-Development-Setup#qemu-emulator--grub-bootloader), then do:

```bash
$ make qemu     # opens a VGA GUI window
```

If you are in a non-GUI environment, it is recommended to redirect VGA output to built-in VNC server, and connect to that server from a VNC client:

```bash
$ make qemu_vnc     # redirects VGA output to VNC server
                    # from VNC client, connect to 'hostname:5901'
```

You will see the QEMU GUI popping up with GRUB loaded. Choose the "`Rux`" option with <kbd>Enter</kbd> to boot into Rux.

For a taste of what a minimal C kernel looks like, please check out the wiki pages of Hux (recommended). I have every single detail documented there.
